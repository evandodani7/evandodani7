# Hi there, I'm Evan 👋

### ML & Robotics engineer passionate about building systems that solve hard problems. I spend my time on deep learning for autonomous offroad vehicles, autonomous UAV payload delivery, and diffusion for data synthesis!

## Featured Projects
Check out some of my work below.

- **[Offroad Autonomy](https://github.com/evandodani7/OffRoadHillClimb)** — Learned dynamics for autonomous offroad driving. Paper coming soon! (Must remain private until paper submission).
- **[Quadrotor ML](https://github.com/evandodani7/ML-7641-Quadrotor-Learned-Payload-Dynamics-Controls)** — Learned payload dynamics and RL for quadrotors.


## Tech Stack
Python • C++ • PyTorch • ROS2 • OpenCV • Git
